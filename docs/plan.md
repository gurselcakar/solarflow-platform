# SolarFlow Platform - Development Plan

## Project Goal
Build a transparent solar energy billing platform for apartment buildings that solves the Solar4All Hackathon challenge: democratizing clean energy access for Germany's 50% of apartment dwellers who can't access solar energy.

**Core Value Proposition:** Transform complex "Mieterstrom" (tenant electricity) billing into transparent, user-friendly experiences for both landlords and tenants.

## What We're Building

### 1. Landlord Dashboard
**Ultra-modern property management interface:**
- **Energy Analytics Hub**: Real-time consumption, production, and savings visualization
- **Smart Invoice Generator**: Automated German-compliant billing using provided template
- **Tenant Management Portal**: Easy tenant info updates, move-in/out handling
- **Building Overview**: Solar panel status, performance metrics, financial summaries
- **Transparency Tools**: Clear PV vs. grid cost breakdowns (26Â¢/kWh vs 33.51Â¢/kWh)

### 2. Tenant Portal
**Consumer-friendly energy dashboard:**
- **Personal Energy Insights**: Solar vs. grid consumption tracking
- **Savings Calculator**: Money saved through rooftop solar access
- **Digital Invoice Viewer**: User-friendly bills with clear cost breakdowns
- **Consumption Patterns**: Historical usage and efficiency trends

### 3. Core Technical Components
**Data processing engine using hackathon dataset:**
- Smart meter integration (15-min intervals from 2-tenant building)
- PV allocation algorithm (proportional distribution)
- German energy billing compliance (EnWG requirements)
- Automated calculations: Base fees (â‚¬10/month), PV rates (â‚¬0.26/kWh), Grid rates (â‚¬0.3351/kWh)

## Business Context
- **Real Impact**: Dach fÃ¼r Dach has 20+ active projects, 200+ people already supplied
- **Market Size**: 50% of Germans (millions) missing solar access in apartments
- **Economics**: PV electricity 22% cheaper than grid (26Â¢ vs 33.51Â¢ per kWh)
- **Regulatory**: Full German energy law compliance built-in

## Key Innovation Areas

### Transparency First
- Visual breakdown of every kWh: solar vs. grid sources
- Clear savings display: "You saved â‚¬X this month with solar"
- Automated legal-compliant invoicing reduces landlord complexity

### User Experience Focus
- Landlord: Managing tenants should be as easy as online banking
- Tenant: Understanding energy bills should be as clear as mobile phone bills
- German market: Full localization and legal compliance

### Data-Driven Insights
- Building performance optimization
- Tenant consumption patterns
- Solar production forecasting
- Cost optimization recommendations

## Development Foundation
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
**Database**: Prisma with hackathon CSV seed data
**Authentication**: Role-based access (Landlord/Tenant)
**Design**: Ultra-modern, clean, light/dark theme support
**Data**: Real smart meter dataset from hackathon (CSV format)
**Compliance**: German energy regulations (EnWG) built-in

## Build Plan

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Foundation
1. **Shadcn/ui Setup**: Configure components with light/dark theme switching
2. **Prisma Configuration**: Database schema + hackathon CSV data seeding
3. **Demo Accounts**: Skip complex onboarding, create pre-configured landlord/tenant accounts

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Core Features
4. **Landing Page**: Emphasize **22% cost savings + management ease** as primary selling points
5. **Landlord Dashboard**: Multi-property support with ultra-modern, clean interface
6. **Tenant Portal**: Energy insights with solar vs. grid consumption tracking
7. **Invoice System**: German-compliant PDF generation with download capability

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: Advanced Features
8. **Live Simulation**: Background process for real-time meter reading simulation
9. **Multi-timeframe Views**: Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly dashboard options
10. **Demo Refinement**: Focus on single month from dataset for clean presentation

### ðŸ“‹ Enhancement Scope (Post-Hackathon)
- **Email Integration**: Automated invoice sending to tenants
- **Invoice Customization**: Company branding beyond core German template
- **Gamification**: Tenant engagement features (savings leaderboards, efficiency badges)
- **Complex Onboarding**: Full tenant invitation and verification flows

### ðŸŽ¬ Demo Strategy
**Hero Message**: "Save 22% on electricity costs while simplifying tenant energy management"
**Data Scope**: Single month focus for clean, compelling demonstration
**User Journey**: Landing â†’ Landlord multi-property dashboard â†’ Invoice generation â†’ Tenant portal
**Evaluation Focus**: Innovation (transparency), Usability (modern UI), Impact (cost savings), Execution (smooth demo)
