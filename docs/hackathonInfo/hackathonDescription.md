# Challenge Description

### Problem
Millions of people pay too much for energy because only 1% of apartment buildings in Germany have solar panels. Nearly 50% of Germans living in those buildings are missing out on affordable, clean energy. ☀️

Our vision: make solar energy easy, fair, and accessible for tenants and landlords alike.

This could mean:

- Making electricity data easy to understand and transparent for both tenants and landlords
- Automating complex billing processes for landlords or energy providers

Think about how you can help democratize access to green electricity in urban communities → turning rooftops into local powerhouses
### Your Mission
Build a prototype that shows how digital solutions can make solar energy more transparent, affordable, and engaging for apartment communities.

You could explore directions like: 📑 📊 🤝 🏢 🎮

- Billing made simple: Create transparent, easy-to-understand bills for tenants and landlords.
- Energy insights: Visualize consumption, production, and savings in engaging ways. 
- Empowered tenants: Show how people benefit directly from rooftop solar (e.g., what share of their usage came from the sun).
- Landlord tools: Help landlords or building managers understand the bigger picture and manage the building, without drowning in complexity.
- (Bonus: Gamification - do you find an idea that makes both user groups happy or motivated about using the platform)

💡 These are examples → feel free to surprise us with your own creative take!

### Resources Provided
- Starter dataset: Example [smart meter data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ewz61gdF84B7qs2hnhlzV5Zq3RVvw2sU?usp=sharing) (per apartment + building + solar).
- Invoice template: A [sample file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15P87Kf_n7TGvYNzOKVBt-9GbVeaA2kg0u37R7VbhAV8/edit?usp=sharing) you can extend or redesign.
- Mentor: Leo ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonard-john/)) from Dach für Dach will be available to answer questions.
### Evaluation Criteria 
Submissions will be judged on:

- Innovation – Did you bring fresh ideas?
- Usability – Is your prototype intuitive and user-friendly?
- Impact – Does it make solar energy feel accessible to tenants and landlords?
- Execution – Does the demo run smoothly and tell a compelling story?
### Deliverables
- Code repository (GitHub/GitLab)
- Short demo video (max. 5 min)
- README & stack overview: how to run it, what stack you used and why
### About Us: Dach für Dach
We’re [Dach für Dach](https://dachfuerdach.de/), and our mission is simple: bring the energy transition to apartment buildings, roof by roof.

Our goal: supply 1,000,000 people with clean solar energy → roof by roof.

Right now, going solar as a tenant is nearly impossible. We’re changing that. Our digital-first Mieterstrom platform supports property owners and installers at every step, from planning and installation to operations.

Founded in Jan 2025 and funded by EnBW, we have currently 20+ ongoing projects with 200+ people being supplied by solar energy for the first time!

👩‍💻 (PS: We’re hiring a Founding Engineer → if you’re interested, hit us up!) 👨‍💻

Our vision: make solar energy easy, fair, and accessible for tenants and landlords alike.

### Hackathon Dataset (FINAL, surplus feed-in model)

Purpose
This dataset models a multi-family house with:
- 2 tenants
- common (shared) loads
- a PV system (operational from **1 Aug 2025**)
It is intended for building and testing billing or visualization platforms in a hackathon setting.

Sheets Overview
#### 1. **Raw** – Absolute meter readings (kWh)

- Columns: `timestamp`, `we1_meter`, `we2_meter`, `general_meter`, `pv_meter`, `sum_meter`
- Formula:  
    `sum_meter = we1_meter + we2_meter + general_meter – pv_meter`  
    → acts as a _virtual main meter_.
#### 2. **Prepared** – Interval values (15-min kWh)

- Columns:
    - `we1_consumption_kWh`
    - `we2_consumption_kWh`
    - `general_consumption_kWh`
    - `sum_consumption_kWh = WE1 + WE2 + General`
    - `pv_generation_kWh`
    - `grid_import_kWh`
    - `grid_export_kWh`
- Import/export derived from changes in `sum_meter`:
    - positive = import
    - negative = export
#### 3. **TenantTariffs** – Tenant pricing model
- **TENANT_T1**:
    - PV: **0.26 €/kWh**
    - Grid: **0.3351 €/kWh**
    - Base fee: **10 €/month**
#### 4. **LandlordSettlement** – Landlord’s perspective
- Grid cost: **0.3351 €/kWh** (passed through to tenants)
- Feed-in revenue: **0.08 €/kWh**
#### 5. **Contracts** – Tenant assignments
- Each tenant is linked to:
    - a consumption column
    - a tariff_id
- Billing cycle: **yearly** (annual settlement)
- Monthly advance payments possible

Billing Logic (per year, example)
For each tenant _i_:
```
PV_share_i   = proportional share of pv_generation_kWh (based on relative consumption)
Grid_share_i = consumption_i – PV_share_i
Cost_i       = (PV_share_i × 0.26) + (Grid_share_i × 0.3351) + base_fee_share
```

For the landlord:
```
Grid purchase cost = total grid_import_kWh × 0.3351
Feed-in revenue    = total grid_export_kWh × 0.08
```

Notes:
- **Timestamps**: local time (no timezone)
- **PV generation**: synthetic but plausible (~3,801 kWh by 12 Sep 2025)
- **Data quirks**: negative or zero intervals may occur due to resets → handle in processing
- **PV allocation**: flexible. Simplest method = proportional to each tenant’s interval consumption

Quick Start for Hackers:
1. Work with the **Prepared** sheet for calculations.
2. Apply tariffs/contracts to assign costs.
3. Aggregate by **month** or **year** for billing simulations.
4. Build a **Billing** sheet showing:
    - tenant costs
    - landlord settlement (grid import costs vs. feed-in revenue).

Dach für Dach – Hackathon Dataset (FINAL, surplus feed-in model)

Purpose
This dataset represents a multi-family house (2 tenants + common loads + PV system, starting Aug 1 2025).
It is designed for developing billing/visualization platforms in a hackathon context.

Sheets overview
1) Raw – Absolute meter readings (kWh):
   timestamp, we1_meter, we2_meter, general_meter, pv_meter, sum_meter
   sum_meter = we1_meter + we2_meter + general_meter – pv_meter (virtual main meter).

2) Prepared – Interval values (kWh per 15-min):
   we1_consumption_kWh, we2_consumption_kWh, general_consumption_kWh, sum_consumption_kWh (= WE1+WE2+General),
   pv_generation_kWh, grid_import_kWh, grid_export_kWh
   Grid import/export derived from Δ(sum_meter): positive = import, negative = export.

3) TenantTariffs – Tariff logic for tenants:
   TENANT_T1: PV 0.26 €/kWh, Grid 0.3351 €/kWh, Base fee 10 €/month.

4) LandlordSettlement – Settlement logic for the landlord:
   Grid cost 0.3351 €/kWh (passed 1:1 to tenants), Feed-in revenue 0.08 €/kWh.

5) Contracts – Tenant assignments:
   Each tenant is linked to one consumption column and tariff_id.
   Billing cycle = yearly (annual settlement), with monthly advance payments possible.

Billing logic (example, per year)
For each tenant i:
  PV_share_i   = proportional share of pv_generation_kWh (based on relative consumption).
  Grid_share_i = consumption_i – PV_share_i.
  Cost_i       = PV_share_i * 0.26 + Grid_share_i * 0.3351 + base_fee_share.

For the landlord:
  Grid purchase cost = total grid_import_kWh * 0.3351.
  Feed-in revenue    = total grid_export_kWh * 0.08.

Notes
- Timestamps: local time (no timezone).
- PV generation is synthetic but plausible, reaching ~3,801 kWh by 12 Sep 2025.
- Negative/zero intervals may appear due to resets; handle accordingly.
- PV allocation method between tenants can be chosen (simplest: proportional by interval consumption).

Quick start for hackers
- Use the Prepared sheet for calculations.
- Use Tariffs/Contracts to assign prices.
- Aggregate per month or year for billing simulation.
- Create a Billing sheet showing tenant costs and landlord settlement (import cost vs feed-in revenue).
